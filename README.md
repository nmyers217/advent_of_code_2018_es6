# Advent of Code 2018 JavaScript

This is just some of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) written in JavaScript.

This repo is just to study and practice so that I will have a head start when December arrives. I am not intending to finish all the questions for 2018 (see my [Nim answers for 2018](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim) if you want a more complete selection of answers).

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Cd into the project directory
3. Run npm install
4. Use node to run any of the scripts in the ./src directory
